    <strong><a>What is a Mutable and Unmutable object? Write an example with a real use case scenario.</a></strong>
    <p>
        An object's identity never changes once it has been created. ... Objects whose value can change are said to be
        mutable. Objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable</p>

    <script>
        var car = {
            color: 'red',
            tyres: '4'

        }

        var anotherCar = car;
        car.color = 'blue';
        console.log(anotherCar.color); // blue
        console.log(car === anotherCar); //true 
    </script>

    <script>
        var aString = "This is a string";
        var bString = aString;
        //now we alter aString
        aString = "The string has changed";

        console.log(aString); //The string has changed
        console.log(bString); //This is a string
        console.log(aString === bString); //false
