    <h1>What is recursion? </h1>
    <p>The classic example of recursive programming involves computing factorials. The factorial of a number is computed
        as that number times all of the numbers below it up to and including <br>1. <strong>For example,</strong>
        factorial(5) is the same as 5*4*3*2*1 , and factorial(3) is 3*2*1</p>

<script>
    // program to find the factorial of a number
    function factorial(x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        else {
            return x * factorial(x - 1);
        }
    }
    const num = 10;
    const result = factorial(num);
    // console.log(`The factorial of ${num} is ${result}`);
    document.write(`The factorial of ${num} is ${result}`);
</script>
