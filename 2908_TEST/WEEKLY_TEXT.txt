1) What do you mean by built in function and user defined function?
	User-defined function means you can create a function for your own use. You can create yourself according to your need.
In JavaScript, these functions are written in between the <HEAD> tag of the HTML page.
   Syntax:
	function function_name()
	{
  	   //Code;
	}

2) What is an anonymous function in JavaScript? 
	- Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.
	function functionName(parameters) {
 	 // code to be executed
	}

3) What is the difference between the regular function() and an arrow function ()=>{}?
	Syntax of regular functions:-
	let x = function function_name(parameters){
 	  // body of the function
	};

	syntax of arrow functions:-
	let x = (parameters) => {
    	// body of the function
	 };

4) What are parameters and arguments in functions?
	- The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value. 
	- The arguments object is a local variable available within all non-arrow functions. You can refer to a function's arguments inside that function by using its arguments object. It has entries for each argument the function was called with, with the first entry's index at 0 . The arguments object is not an Array

5) How to empty an array in JavaScript? 
	- Substituting with a new array − arr = []; This is the fastest way. ...
	- Setting length prop to 0 − arr.length = 0. This will clear the existing array by setting its length to 0. ...
	- Splice the whole array. arr.splice(0, arr.length)

6) What is .some function in JS?
    - The some() method checks if any of the elements in an array pass a tes
    - If it finds an array element where the function returns a true value, some() returns true (and does not check the remaining values)
    - Otherwise it returns false
    ------ code ----
    const array = [1, 7, 3, 9, 5];
    const even = (element) => element % 2 === 0;
    console.log(array.some(even));
------------------------------
7) What is dense arrays and sparse arrays?
	----

8) What is the key difference between forEach() and map() in JavaScript?
	forEach() — executes a provided function once for each array element.
		---------code--------
		arr.forEach((num, index) => {
    		return arr[index] = num * 2;
		 });  // arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
		
	map() — creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
	------------code ----------
		- let doubled = arr.map(num => {
   		  return num * 2;
		  });
		// doubled = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

9) What is the difference between slice and splice in JavaScript?
	- slice():-
		- slice method is used to get a new array by selecting a sub-array of a given array.
		- The changes do not reflect in the original array.
		- The result has to be assigned to a new array variable.
		- The return value is new array with the values in the selected sub-array of the given array. The values in the range start to (end-1) will be selected.
		- Takes exactly 2 arguments
	- splice():-
		- splice method is used to add/remove an item from the given array.
		- The changes reflect in the original array
		- The result need not be assigned to any other new variable.
		- The return value is an array containing the deleted element.
		- Takes ‘n’ number of arguments (a list of new items can be supplied)

10) What is filter method in JavaScript?
	- Filter method use to apply filter to find useful data.
		--	const ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];
			ages.filter(checkAdult)    // Returns [32, 33, 40]
			function checkAdult(age) {
  			return age >= 18;}			
		
11) What is strings in JavaScript? Explain any five string method with example.
	- zero or more characters written inside quotes.is known as string
	Five String Method
	- slice() - slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
		--	let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
			str.slice(7, 13)     // Returns Banana

	- substring() - substring() is similar to slice() small difference it cannot accept negative indexes
		--	let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
			substring(7, 13)    // Returns Banana
	- substr() -	substr() is similar to slice(), he difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part
		-- 	let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
			str.substr(7, 6)    // Returns Banana
	- replace() -	The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
		-- 	let text = "RAM AVTAR";
			let newText = text.replace("RAJU KUMAR BAGHEL");
	- concat()	concat() joins two or more strings:
		-- 	let text1 = "Hello";
			let text2 = "World";
			let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2);

12) What are escape character in JavaScript?
	- Escape sequences are typically used to specify actions such as carriage returns and tab movements on terminals and printers.
	- \'	'	Single quote
	- \"	"	Double quote
	- \\	\	Backslash

13) How do you find the length of an array and string in JavaScript?
	- The length property sets or returns the number of elements in an array.
------------code---------------
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.write(fruits.length);
var fruits = [25,45,34,67,8];
document.write(fruits.length); 
--------

14) Explain try...catch statement in JavaScript.
	- The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
	- The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
------------ code -----------
 try {
    if(x == "") throw "is Empty";
    if(isNaN(x)) throw "not a number";
    if(x > 10) throw "too high";
    if(x < 5) throw "too low";
  }
  catch(err) {
    message.innerHTML = "Input " + err;
  }
---------------------

15) How do you convert number String to an integer.
	- In JavaScript parseInt() function is used to convert the string to an integer. This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt() function.
parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number.
---------- code ------------
<script>
  
    function convertStoI() {
        var a = "100";
        var b = parseInt(a);
        document.write("Integer value is" + b);
        var d = parseInt("3 11 43");
        document.write("</br>");  
        document.write('Integer value is ' + d);
  
    }
convertStoI(); 
</script> 
--------------------------------
